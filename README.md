Please complete a technical assessment focusing on OTP-based authentication,
claim-based authorization, and securing a dummy API. This exercise is designed to
evaluate your server-side authentication and authorization skills.
--------------
Task Overview:
--------------
1. OTP-based Authentication:
○ Implement OTP-based two-factor authentication using Node.js and
Express.
○ Utilize the speakeasy library for OTP generation and verification.
○ Generate a secret, create an OTP URI, and send it to the client.
○ Implement a server endpoint to verify the OTP.
2. Claim-Based Authorization:
○ Extend the authentication system to include claim-based authorization.
○ Assign different claims (roles or permissions) to users.
○ Implement middleware or a mechanism to enforce access control based
on claims.
○ Ensure that only authorized users can perform specific actions within the
API.
3. API Security:
○ Secure a dummy API with the OTP-based authentication and claim-based
authorization you implemented.
------------------------
Submission Instructions:
------------------------
1. Use npm to install the necessary dependencies (express and speakeasy).
2. Implement the OTP-based authentication, claim-based authorization, and API
security as per the instructions.
3. Submit your solution as a ZIP file or share a link to your GitHub repository.
Important Notes:
● Ensure your solution is well-organized, and the code is clean, expressive and
readable.
● Clearly document the claims and their respective authorization rules.
● Include any additional information or assumptions made during the
implementation.
